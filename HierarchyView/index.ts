/**
 * A virtual (React) field control.
 *
 * The difference from the standard control is the whole point: `updateView`
 * *returns* an element instead of writing into a container, so the platform
 * owns reconciliation and React never enters the bundle — it is declared as a
 * `<platform-library>` and resolved at runtime by the host.
 *
 * `updateView` still runs on every change to any bound value, including ones
 * this control caused itself. With React that shows up as a controlled-input
 * problem rather than a caret-jumping one: derive state from props, and resync
 * on the *content* of a prop rather than its identity, since every pass hands
 * down fresh objects.
 *
 * The state read below is the same set the standard `index.ts` handles, and it
 * is here for the same reason: every branch is a state a real form puts a
 * control into, and each one is invisible until a customer hits it.
